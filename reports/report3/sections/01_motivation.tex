\section{Motivation}
This project analyzes the artist collaboration network on Spotify to identify musical trends. 
The goal is to study artist popularity and their connections using centrality and clustering metrics. 
 The statistical significance of the metrics calculated on the Spotify network is evaluated against random networks, for an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of artistic collaboration. 
 The analysis was performed using the NetworkX and NetworKit packages. The results provide a basis for further research.
