\section{Experimental setup}

All computations on graphs have been performed on the CAPRI High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster \cite{capri}. The hardware capabilities and the presence of the SLURM job scheduler system allowed us to perform heavy computations in a feasible time frame. This system features the following hardware:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 16 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6130 @ 2.10GHz CPUs
    \item 6 TB DDR4 RAM
    \item 2 NVIDIA Tesla P100 16GB GPUs
    \item 40 TB of disk space
\end{itemize}

On the other side, the analysis of the data computed by the cluster has been performed on our local machines. They all employ AMD Ryzen 5/7 CPUs and RAMs ranging from 8 GBs and 24 GBs.
