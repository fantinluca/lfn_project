\section{Dataset}

For this project, we used the Spotify Artist Feature Collaboration Network from Kaggle \cite{dataset}. This dataset consists of a graph where nodes correspond to artists and edges connect artists who have collaborated on at least one song. It has 156,422 nodes, which include around 20,000 artists who appeard in the Spotify weekly charts and around 136,000 artists who had at least one feature with the chart artists, and 300,386 edges between them. Out of the information included with the nodes, the ones we used to analyze our results are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item artist popularity, expressed as an integer number between 0 and 100 (100 corresponding to the most popular artist on the service), according to the Spotify API;
    \item list of genres, according to the Spotify API.
\end{itemize}
