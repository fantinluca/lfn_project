\section{Future work}

Our analysis on the whole dataset and its genre subgraphs is mainly concerned with the node-level metrics. Future extensions of our work could be comparing the graph-level metrics of these graphs to study how network dynamic change within the whole network between different genres.

Another open field is using the other features included in the dataset, like the number of followers and the number of chart hits of each artist, for the same analyses presented in this report. This also includes using the popularity level more extensively than what has been reported here.
