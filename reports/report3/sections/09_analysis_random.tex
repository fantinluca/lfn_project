\section{Data analysis on random graphs}

For the significance analysis we considered the real graph and a selection of subgraphs. Because of the NetworkX implementation of the Holme-Kim, these graphs had to have more edges than nodes and a global clustering coefficient lower than 0.3 to be accurately resembled by the random graphs. For each of these graphs, 100 random graphs were generated, with the same number of nodes, a similar number of edges and a comparable global clustering coefficient. For the
