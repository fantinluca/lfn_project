\section{Code}

All the code developed for this project, together with results files, dataset files and more, can be found in our GitHub repository \cite{githubRepo}. The central script is \texttt{main.py}, which computes any combination of the measures presented in section \ref{sec:measures} on various graphs, depending on the command line arguments provided. The script can work on the entire dataset, subgraphs taken from the dataset with respect to certain genres or popularity thresholds, and random graphs generated with the Holme-Kim model \cite{Holme2002} with parameters specified through the command line arguments. The libraries NetworkX \cite{networkx} and NetworKit \cite{networkit} are used to represent the graphs, compute the metrics and generate the random graphs.
