\section{Experiments}

We have determined the feasibility of performing our experiments on the CAPRI cluster \cite{capri}. The project repository can be cloned and the necessary Python packages can be installed on our own profile, making it easy to efficiently translate the code development done on our own machines into this testing environment. For any computation, we will submit our jobs to the cluster via the SLURM work scheduler. This allows us to exploit the full computational power of CAPRI while also keeping track of execution time and resource usage.

\section{Statistical hypothesis testing}

Our statistical hypothesis testing procedure will comprise of two steps. Any statistical test assumes that the considered population has a known distribution, most often a Gaussian one. Because of the specificity of our definition of random graph, instead of analytically computing the distribution \emph{a priori} of the centrality metrics of our model, the first step will compute how similar this distribution is compared to a Gaussian distribution starting from the features computed on the actual generated graphs, through a \emph{normality test}. We will use Shapiro-Wilk test \cite{ShapiroWilk1965}, since it is considered the most powerful normality test available \cite{RazaliYap2011}. The second step will actually determine how likely it is for the features computed on the real graph to have been drawn from the same distributions as the random graph. The available tests will be determined by the output of the first step.

\section*{Contributions}

Out of the work presented in this report, Fabio Cociancich wrote the Python scripts to extract the subgraphs based on genre and artists, Alessandro Lincetto wrote the script to generate random graphs and compute their metrics, and Luca Fantin investigated how to use the CAPRI cluster and the statistical tests to use, as well as performing an early refactoring of our code. In addition, each of the members wrote the section related to their work. The percentage of work done can thus be estimated in 35\%, 20\% and 45\% respectively.

%\addtolength{\textheight}{-5cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths

                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
